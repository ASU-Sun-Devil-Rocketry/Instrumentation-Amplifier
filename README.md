<h1>Rail to Rail Instrumentation Amplifier with Regulated Supply</h1>

<p><u>Current PCB Revision:</u> 2.0 <p>
<p>PCB Part Number: L0001</p>

<p>The instrumentation amplifier IC uses an adjustable gain differential amplifier with buffered inputs to amplify the readings from an analog sensor using a wheatstone bridge such as a load cell or pressure transducer. The amplifier supply voltage was chosen to match that of the pressure transducers it is intended to be used with.</p>
